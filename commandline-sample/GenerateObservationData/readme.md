## Generate Observation Data for Nexosis API

This utility can help you load upload sample data to the Nexosis API, but looking through the code will also help you understand how to save large datasets, and run forecasts on that saved data.

### Concepts:
- Working with large data sets
- Starting a forecast on an existing data set
- Getting results from a completed session

### Usage Notes
- Get your api key first by signing up at [our api management site](https://developers.nexosis.com)
- Update the [Nexosis Api Client nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nexosis.Api.Client/) before compiling. If there are breaking changes, look for a new version of this code.
